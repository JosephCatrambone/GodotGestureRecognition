# GodotGestureRecognition

This is the companion repo to my article "Pure* Godot Gesture Recognition: Machine Learning End-to-End" available on my website here: https://www.josephcatrambone.com/?p=1352

This was built with Godot 4.0alpha2 but should be trivially updated to 3.4.x by changing the inline comments.
